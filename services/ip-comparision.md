The differences between **Public IP**, **Private IP**, and **Elastic IP** in AWS (and general networking) revolve around their visibility, scope, and use cases:

### 1. **Public IP Address**
- **Visibility**: Globally accessible over the internet.
- **Scope**: Can be reached from any device connected to the internet.
- **Use Case**: 
  - Assigned to resources that need to be accessible from the public internet, such as web servers, APIs, or services available to external clients.
  - Typically assigned automatically by AWS when a resource (like an EC2 instance) is launched in a public subnet and has internet access enabled.
- **Lifespan**:
  - Automatically assigned by AWS and can change upon instance stop/start.
  - Not static; if an instance is stopped or restarted, the public IP address might change.
- **Costs**: No additional cost for public IP addresses in AWS, but data transfer fees apply when interacting with the internet.

### 2. **Private IP Address**
- **Visibility**: Only accessible within the private network (VPC).
- **Scope**: Used for communication between resources within the same VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) or connected networks (e.g., via VPN or VPC Peering).
- **Use Case**:
  - Used for internal communication between EC2 instances, databases, or other services that don't need to be accessed from the public internet.
  - Essential for secure and isolated network environments where resources communicate internally without exposure to the internet.
- **Lifespan**:
  - Private IP addresses are persistent during the lifetime of the instance (even if it's stopped and restarted).
  - They are associated with the instance's network interface (ENI).
- **Costs**: No cost associated with using private IPs within the VPC.

### 3. **Elastic IP Address (EIP)**
- **Visibility**: Publicly accessible, similar to a public IP.
- **Scope**: Static IP address that is reachable from the internet.
- **Use Case**:
  - Used when you need a **persistent, static IP** that remains the same even if the underlying resource (such as an EC2 instance) is stopped, terminated, or replaced.
  - Commonly used when hosting applications that require a fixed public IP address (e.g., for whitelisting, DNS configuration).
  - You can remap the Elastic IP to another instance quickly if your instance fails, providing high availability.
- **Lifespan**:
  - Manually allocated by the user and remains in your account until you explicitly release it.
  - It persists through EC2 instance stop/start cycles, unlike the auto-assigned public IP address.
  - You can disassociate and reassociate it with another instance as needed.
- **Costs**:
  - **Free** if the Elastic IP is associated with a running instance.
  - There is a cost if the Elastic IP is not in use (not attached to an instance) to avoid wastage of public IP addresses.

### Summary of Differences:

| **Type**       | **Scope**        | **Visibility**         | **Persistence**              | **Cost**                          | **Use Case**                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public IP**  | Internet          | Globally accessible     | Dynamic (can change on reboot)| No extra charge (except data transfer fees) | External-facing resources needing internet access (e.g., web servers).        |
| **Private IP** | VPC/Internal      | Internal only           | Static (while instance exists)| Free                             | Internal communication within a VPC (e.g., databases, microservices).         |
| **Elastic IP** | Internet          | Globally accessible     | Static (persists through stops/reboots) | Free when attached, charged when idle | Persistent, fixed IP address for external services requiring high availability.|

### When to Use Each:
- **Public IP**: For temporary or non-critical external-facing resources where the IP address can change (like development instances).
- **Private IP**: For secure internal communication between resources that donâ€™t require internet access.
- **Elastic IP**: For production services that require a stable and permanent public IP address, especially in use cases that demand high availability or external systems whitelisting.

Elastic IPs are preferred when a fixed IP address is crucial, while public and private IPs are more dynamic and suited for typical resource management.
